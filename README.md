# DiscorQL

DiscorQL is a project aimed at providing the full set of features that the Discord API provides as a GraphQL server. This could be useful for building admin dashboards, bot tools and server analytics tools. To be quite honest I don't know what I'm going to use it for and this project may turn into some type of bot itself, but I really could not say.

As of now I plan to build a basic front-end for using most of the features: Queries, Mutations, and Subscriptions using Apollo and React for demonstration.

If you have any suggestions as to what should be added or anything please feel free to submit a PR or file an issue :)

## Why?

Because I've been dabbling in GraphQL for a while now and I thought this would be a useful demo for what GraphQL is capable of and possibly something others could learn from. I also thought it would be really helpful when building client-side applications to have full access to the discord API without having some type of REST interface between client and server, mostly useful for dashboards and admin pages I would assume.

## WIP

I'll add more information here soon as I figure things out.

# Phoenix

To start your Phoenix server:

- Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
- Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
- Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
- Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
